Testflinger
============

.. A single sentence that says what the product is, succinctly and memorably.

Testflinger is a system for orchestrating the time-sharing of access to a pool of
target machines.

.. A paragraph of one to three short sentences, that describe what the product does.

Each Testflinger system consists of:

* a web service (called just Testflinger) that provides an API to request jobs
  by placing them on a queue
* per machine agents that wait for jobs to placed on queues they can service
  and then process them

Jobs can be either fully automated scripts that can attempt to complete within
the allocated time or interactive shell sessions.

.. A third paragraph of similar length, this time explaining what need the product meets.

The Testflinger system is particular useful for sharing finite machine resources
between different consumers in a predictable fashion.
 

.. Finally, a paragraph that describes whom the product is useful for.

Typically this has been used for managing a test lab where CI/CD test runs and
also exploratory testing by human operators is desired.
