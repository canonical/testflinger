Testflinger
============

Testflinger is a system for orchestrating time-shared access to a pool of
target machines.

Each Testflinger system consists of:

* a web service (called just Testflinger) that provides an API to request jobs
  by placing them on a queue
* per-machine agents that wait for jobs to be placed on queues they can service
  and then process them

Jobs can be either fully automated scripts that can attempt to complete within
the allocated time or interactive shell sessions.

The Testflinger system is particularly useful for sharing finite machine resources
between different consumers in a predictable fashion.

Typically this has been used for managing a test lab where CI/CD test runs and
also exploratory testing by human operators is desired.
