Authentication and Authorisation
--------------------------------

Authentication requires a client_id and a secret_key. These credentials can be
obtained by contacting the server administrator with the queues you want priority
access for as well as the maximum priority level to set for each queue. The
expectation is that these credentials are shared between users on a team. 

These credentials can be :doc:`set using the Testflinger CLI <../how-to/authentication>`.
