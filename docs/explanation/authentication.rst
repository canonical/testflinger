Authentication and Authorisation
--------------------------------

Authentication requires a client_id and a secret_key. These credentials can be
obtained by contacting the server administrator with the queues you want priority
access for, the maximum priority level to set for each queue, and any restricted
queues that you need access to. The expectation is that these credentials are
shared between users on a team.

These credentials can be :doc:`set using the Testflinger CLI <../how-to/authentication>`.
