Extended Reservation
====================

Normal users can reserve a machine with Testflinger for a maximum of 6 hours.
However, for certain use cases this is limiting. Testflinger has the ability
to allow authorised clients to request longer reservation times. See the Reserve
section of the :doc:`Test Phase <../reference/test-phases>` documentation for more
information on how to set reservation times.
Using this feature requires :doc:`authenticating <./authentication>` with
Testflinger server.
