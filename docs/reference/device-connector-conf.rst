Device connector configuration options
=======================================

The configuration of a device connector contains details that are unique to this device, such as the IP address and environment data that should be used when running tests on this device.

The device connector configuration is normally stored in a file called ``default.yaml`` in the source where the device connector runs.

The configuration options listed below are available for all device connectors unless otherwise specified. For the list of supported types of device connectors, see :doc:`device-connector-types`.

     - MaaS Node ID for the specific agent on the MaaS server associated with this test device
   * - ``reset_efi``
     - maas
     - Attempt to reset EFI systems to boot from the network in order to work around issues with the boot order sometimes getting lost on systems that require USB Ethernet dongles
   * - ``clear_tpm``
     - maas
     - Attempt to clear the TPM before provisioning the system, for SecureBoot systems
   * - ``snappy_writable_partition``
     - dragonboard
     - The writable partition for injecting the cloud-init user data for enabling a default user
   * - ``post_flash_cmds``
     - netboot
     - Netboot device connector specific steps needed after flashing the image that may be device-specific
   * - ``recovery_cmds``
     - oemrecovery
     - List of commands to execute that will trigger “recovery” on the specified device
   * - ``control_switch_device_cmd``
     - muxpi
     - Muxpi/SDWire command to execute to switch control of the SD card over to the test device so that it can boot the image
   * - ``control_switch_local_cmd``
     - muxpi
     - Muxpi/SDWire command to execute to switch control of the SD card over to the SD MUX controller so that it can flash an image
   * - ``post_provision_script``
     - muxpi
     - List of commands that must be executed on the test device after provisioning, with the test image mounted, for doing device-specific configuration
   * - ``control_host``
     - cm3, muxpi
     - IP of the sidecar device or “controller” that can be used to assist with provisioning. This device should already be configured for ssh using a key on the agent host.
   * - ``control_user``
     - cm3, muxpi
     - User to ssh to on the control_host (default: ``ubuntu``)
   * - ``test_device``
     - cm3, dragonboard, muxpi, netboot
     - Block device used for writing the test image. This device will be erased and overwritten with the requested image for provisioning.
   * - ``select_master_script``
     - dragonboard, netboot
     - List of commands used to force booting into the “stable” image that is used for provisioning the device
   * - ``select_test_script``
     - dragonboard, netboot
     - List of commands used to force booting into the “test” image once provisioning is complete
