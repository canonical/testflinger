**Testflinger agent** connects to the [Testflinger Server](../server/README.md)
to request and service test submissions.

## Basic Usage

To start an agent process with a given [configuration], simply run:

```shell
testflinger-agent -c /path/to/testflinger-agent.conf
```

## Installation

Testflinger is available on all major Linux distributions.

The [`testflinger-agent-host`][charmhub-site] charm provides a simple way to
deploy multiple agents on a unified host which manages the agents as services
with [Supervisor][supervisord].

On juju-ready systems, you can deploy the agent host on the command-line with:

```shell
juju deploy testflinger-agent-host
```

You can also install `testflinger-agent` as a Python package with `pip`:

```shell
pip install "testflinger-agent @ git+https://github.com/canonical/testflinger#subdirectory=agent"
```
