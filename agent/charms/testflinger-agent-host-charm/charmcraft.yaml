summary: Testflinger host for device agents
description: |
  Testflinger is a system for orchestrating the time-sharing of access to a pool
  of target machines.

  This charm provides the base system for a host system that will be used for
  Testflinger device agents. It installs the base dependencies and provides a
  target for deploying the `testflinger-agent` along with
  `testflinger-device-connector` on top of. Additionally, it copies the scripts
  in `src/tf-cmd-scripts/` to the host system. The scripts would be used by the
  `testflinger-agent` to trigger the `testflinger-device-connector` at each
  phase.

  The Testflinger agent is a per-machine service that runs on an agent host
  system. The agent is configured with a set of queues for which it knows how to
  run jobs. When it is not running a job, the agent:

  - Asks the server for a job to run from the list of configured queues
  - Dispatches the device connector to execute each phase of the job
  - Reports the results of the job back to the server
  - Uploads artifacts (if any) saved from the job to the server
