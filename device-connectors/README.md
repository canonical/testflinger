# Testflinger Device Connectors

[![Documentation status][rtd-badge]][rtd-latest]

**Testflinger Device Connectors** provides a unified way for provisioning,
maintaining, and running tests on devices with different provision types.

## Basic Usage

Given a device's [provision type][provision-types], device connector
[configuration][config-schema], and [job][job-schema], you can provision a
device with:

```shell
testflinger-device-connectors $PROVISION_TYPE allocate -c /path/to/default.yaml job.json
```

You can update firmware with:

```shell
testflinger-device-connectors $PROVISION_TYPE firmware_update -c /path/to/default.yaml job.json
```

You can run a test on a device with:

```shell
testflinger-device-connectors $PROVISION_TYPE runtest -c /path/to/default.yaml job.json
```

You can allocate a device with:

```shell
testflinger-device-connectors $PROVISION_TYPE allocate -c /path/to/default.yaml job.json
```

You can reserve a device with:

```shell
testflinger-device-connectors $PROVISION_TYPE reserve -c /path/to/default.yaml job.json
```

To learn more about the different test phases, refer to the
[Test phases][test-phases] documentation.

`testflinger-device-connectors` will exit with a value of `46` if something goes
wrong during device recovery. This can be used as an indication that the device
is unusable for some reason, and can't be recovered using automated recovery
mechanisms. The system calling the device connector may want to take further
action, such as alerting someone that it needs manual recovery, or to stop
attempting to run tests on it until it's fixed.

## Installation

Testflinger is available on all major Linux distributions.

You can install `testflinger-device-connectors` with `pip`:

```shell
pip install "testflinger-device-connectors @ git+https://github.com/canonical/testflinger#subdirectory=device-connectors"
```
