image-deploy.sh originally comes from:
https://git.launchpad.net/~oem-solutions-engineers/pc-enablement/+git/oem-scripts/tree/image-deploy.sh

This script was adapted to TF agent environment.
Any url links to internal repos were removed, so the configs files should be provided with agent attachments. If optional configs are missing, they will be generated by the script itself.
