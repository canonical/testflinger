provision-image.sh script was forked from:
https://git.launchpad.net/~oem-solutions-engineers/pc-enablement/+git/oem-scripts/tree/image-deploy.sh

This script was adapted to TF agent environment and has major differences:
- Any url links to internal repos were removed, so the configs files should be provided with agent attachments.
- If optional configs are missing, they will be generated by the script itself.
- ISO is downloaded to target DUT directly without storing on the agent.
