**Testflinger CLI** is the tool for interacting with a Testflinger server. It
can be used to submit jobs, check the status of jobs, and get the job results.

## Basic Usage

A [test job][job-schema] is defined by a YAML or JSON file.

Given a job file, Testflinger submits a new test job with:

```shell
testflinger-cli submit job.yaml
```

After successfully submitting a job, check the status of your job with:

```shell
testflinger-cli status d14d2e31-f239-41b6-9a74-32f538e71cde
```

You can also watch the output of the job as it runs by polling it with:

```shell
testflinger-cli poll d14d2e31-f239-41b6-9a74-32f538e71cde
```

After a job is finished, you can check the results of the test with:

```shell
testflinger-cli results d14d2e31-f239-41b6-9a74-32f538e71cde
```

Finally, you can download the artifact tarball from the test with:

```shell
testflinger-cli artifacts d14d2e31-f239-41b6-9a74-32f538e71cde
```

## Installation

Testflinger is available on all major Linux distributions.

On snap-ready systems, you can install it on the command-line with:

```shell
sudo snap install testflinger-cli
```

In order for Testflinger to access files/directories in removable media, you
need to connect the `removable-media` interface manually:

```shell
sudo snap connect testflinger-cli:removable-media
```
